        <p className="para">Pediatric brain tumours (PBT) are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children under the age of 20. Treatments are often ineffective and have significant effects on quality of life. New “precision medicine” treatments using genomic and molecular analyses have a great deal of potential, but there are barriers in bringing targeted treatments to pediatric populations. </p>

        </div>
        <p className="para">In this study, we gathered data about the social, ethical, economic, and legal challenges of researching and developing new pharmaceutical treatments for pediatric brain tumours. Our aim was to identify and understand the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of safer and more effective treatments, facilitate communication across stakeholder groups, and highlight potential interventions.  </p>
