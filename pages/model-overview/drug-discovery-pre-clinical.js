At this stage, in-vivo studies are conducted to understand optimal dosage, rates of metabolism and elimination, and the half-life of the drug. Toxicologic studies help to shed light on the drug&apos;s potential toxicity. This stage involves regulatory oversight and approval to ensure that studies are conducted safely and ethically. </p>

Human capital also includes human subject volunteers who participate in clinical trials.</p>

The competitive nature of academic publishing may create a reluctance among scientists to share data for fear of being scooped. Researchers may also encounter challenges to sharing data and know-how within the broader scientific community due to onerous legal agreements, and/or costly or nonexistent sharing platforms/infrastructure (e.g. contracts between CROs or industry partners, NDAs, proprietary sharing platforms and libraries). </p>
